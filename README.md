# Student Test Score Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting student test scores using machine learning regression techniques. 
The goal is to build a robust end-to-end ML pipeline that handles preprocessing, model training, 
validation, and prediction.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset is sourced from a Kaggle Playground competition and includes various numerical and 
categorical features related to student performance.

## ⚙️ Workflow
- Data loading and exploration
- Feature preprocessing (scaling & encoding)
- Model training using Gradient Boosting Regressor
- K-Fold Cross Validation
- Evaluation using RMSE
- Final prediction and submission generation

## 🧠 Model Used
- Gradient Boosting Regressor
- StandardScaler
- OneHotEncoder
- K-Fold Cross Validation

## 📈 Evaluation Metric
